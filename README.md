## <a name='overview'></a>Overview
This frontend code base allows users to navigate Replate's web platform. Business owners can post excess food to be picked up and volunteer users can sign in to see what food items are available to be picked up, claim 1 or more, and pick them up to be delivered to partner organizations such as homeless shelters, soup kitchens, etc. Business owners and volunteers must register and create profiles in order to access functionality of the app. 

## Junior React Developers (Revisit throughout week to update/modify)
Applied JavaScript | Intro-to-React| Single Page Application | TeamWork Capabilities | Form Managment
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
Student used little to no event handlers in the application. Student cannot demonstrate individual contribution of event handlers in the project. | Student cannot demonstrate individual contribution of reusable React components, or useEffect and useState hooks. | React router was not used, no use of GET requests are found within the application. Student can not demonstrate individual contribution of network calls or React router usage. | TBD | Forms are not controlled by React state, and student cannot defend decision to use uncontrolled components. Performance of the app suffers due to improper form management.

React Application | HTTP/AJAX | State Management | TeamWork Capabilities |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
Student failed to deploy a dynamically rendered react application. Static landing page is not incorporated with the overall application. | Complete CRUD operations are not found throughout the application. Student cannot demonstrate that they individually created pages that complete all CDUD operations. Authentication is not handled in the client application. | The state management system has either not been implemented, or is incoherent. State is lost in the process of using the application. Student cannot demonstrate that they individually leveraged or supported the building of the state management system. | TBD |

# Product Vision Document :tada:

## Replate
Do you own a business? Would you like to make a big impact in your community? Replate is an easy to use app that allows you as a business owner to effortlessly have those extras picked up by a Replate volunteer and donated to one of our worthy partner organizations. You just choose a convenient time and a volunteer will show up to take your extras to a predetermined place of need!

#### Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
- This app contains two user types. (1) A business owner who can log in, create a profile for her business, and create pickup requests, and (2) a volunteer who can log in, create a profile, see a list of the pickup requests generated by business owners, and claim one or multiple pickup requests.
- **Landing Page**: Has a nav bar with title: "Replate", and separate login/register buttons for business owners and volunteers. Both user types are required to register and log in to view or interact with data. <br>
-- *Pages for Potential Businesses*
- **Prison Listing Page**: After clicking on the "for employers" button, no need to log in. Contains a list of prisons who have posted employee (aka prisoner) profiles. Each prison is laid out in a grid format, with the name of the prison, number of people available to work (total number of entries a given career coach has submitted), and the physical address/location of the prison. Clicking on a prison card takes you to the employee (aka prisoner) profile listing page.
- **Employee Listing Page**: After clicking on the prison card, non-logged in users can view the list of employee profiles associated with that prison.
- **Single Employee Page**: After clicking on a single employee card, users can read more about a single employee (prisoner) list of resume and job skills. <br>
-- *Pages for Career Coaches (aka Prison Admins)*
- **Register Page**
- **Login Page**
- **Create a Prison Page**: Career Coach led to this page if no profile is created yet. After creation, Prison is added to list of prison page for employer view. Assuming Prison Profile is already created, and Career Coach is logged in, they are directed to Career Coach Dashboard Page.
- **Career Coach Dashboard Page**: where career coach can see employees created by them for their particular prison in an employee list view, and have options to create, delete and otherwise edit them.
- **Create an Employee Page**. Should include name, availability (permissions to work in prison only or able to have work leave), and list of skills and/or previous work experience. The profile can be edited and deleted after creation.
- **Navigation** - Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab. 

#### Stretch Goals (Keep in mind this project has to be accomplished in one week)
- A single user could search for prisons by entering their zip code and defining a search radius. An admin can upload a pdf of a prisoner’s resume.

#### Proposal
- What problem does your app solve?
  * Help fix the prison system by rehabilitating prison inmates. Fight prejudice and profiling in the social system and also helps employers find valuable employees after prisoners transition to civilian life.

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
  * Creates a space where employers can offer career services for prison inmates looking to change their lives. Allows business owners to find employees easily near them and to make a difference in their employees lives for the better by analyzing their resumes and skills. 
- What is the mission statement? 
  * Reconnect prisoners to civilian life and offer a them a second chance by assisting employers in the finding and hiring of prison inmates as employees both in prison and afterwards in their transition into civilian life.


#### Features
- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
  * Ability for employers to view prison and prisoner data.
  * A way for prison admin (career coaches) to register and log in and create and edit prison and prisoner data.
  * A way for employers to communicate interest in employees to career coaches for future hiring.

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
*Zip code search... functionality to donate legal services to help prisoners clean their records and get better services for rehabilitation... 

#### What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
1. Olio– When it comes to wasted food, Olio is at the top of its game. Instead of local bakeries discarding products like bread and bagels, they are picked up and posted on Olio. Started in 2015, the project has 450,000 participants in 32 countries! A third of those who use the app fall under the poverty line, which makes it philanthropic and food-waste friendly!
2. Food Rescue US–Food Rescue US is another great app that reduces food waste in the United States. Luckily, this app makes it very easy for those who donate, deliver and provide food to find each other! If you’re a restaurant or grocer, you can list the food you’d like to donate. Then, a driver can deliver it to an agency or food pantry that’s looking for that item!
3. # La Piat – If you’re looking for a meal at the end of the day, La Piat is a food sharing app Canada can be proud of! Based in Toronto, this app values regulation so all chefs have to have their Ontario Food Handling Certificate. All you have to do is peruse the pictures of available food. Once you pick your item, it will be delivered to you!

1. Couldn't really find anything like it. Government websites do provide info on what to do before hiring prison inmates and what benefits you could have: https://www.bop.gov/business/employing_former_inmates.jsp



#### UX Design
- What design system will you use?
  * Figma Tool to build out wire frames for design and user flow, color pallete etc.
  * Styled Components
  
###### What is the URL to your wireframes?
https://www.figma.com/file/yhmSmrIblvKqJcjEGITNVZ/PrisonSkills?node-id=0%3A1

  * Tool to pick with : Adobe Pallete Picker
  * Color palette choice: See figma...
  * Type system: TBD
  * Tool to reference: TBD
  * Typography choice: TBD
  * Icon system:


#### What will your user flow be?
- Landing Page -> Business button for business owner login/dashboard, and volunteer button for volunteer login/dashboard.
- Business owner flow will lead to registration/login, then creating a business profile, then a dashboard where business owner can post pickup requests and manage their existing requests. Business owner can edit their profile, cancel existing requests they've created, and view the profile(s) of the volunteer(s) who claim their pickup requests.
- Volunteer flow will lead to registration/login, then creating a volunteer profile, then a dashboard where the volunteer can see a list of unclaimed pickup requests. Once a volunteer claims a pickup request and delivers it, the volunteer can mark the pickup as complete.

#### Frameworks and Libraries

#### Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? 
  * Restaurant owners who are interested in giving back to the communities that support them. And volunteers from local non-profit organizations that distribute food to those who need it.

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
  * Needs to be informative, needs to offer links to more information since this is full of potential worries for business owners.

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
  * There is not much else out there for this type of service. 

#### Research
_Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday._

**Research material:**
https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america - "For more than 35 years, Feeding America has responded to the hunger crisis in America by providing food to people in need through a nationwide network of food banks."
https://familyapp.com/try-a-food-sharing-app/ - This page contains a list of 3 apps that operate in a manner similar to Replate.
https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs - This page contains information about the foodwaste in the U.S.
https://www.gocopia.com/ - Copia is an app with goals similar to our own.
https://undark.org/2019/07/02/food-waste-apps/ - criticism of food sharing apps
https://toogoodtogo.com/en-us - TooGoodToGo is another app that connects users/customers with unsold food from shops and restaurants for a discount


#### Prototype Key Features
This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.

- User can create an account as either a `volunteer` or a `business`
- Authenticated `business` can:
--- create, read, update, and delete their business profile (username, business name, business address, phone number)
--- create a pickup request (type of food item, amount of food by count/weight, preferred pickup time)
--- cancel/delete or update a pickup request
--- view the profile of the volunteer who claims a pickup request
- Authenticated `volunteer` can:
--- create, read, update, and delete a volunteer profile (username, volunteer's name, phone number)
--- view a list of unassigned pickup requests that have been created by all business users
--- select a pending pickup and be presented with a detail view
--- accept/claim a pending pickup and it will be added to volunteer's list of assigned pickups
--- cancel/delete a claimed pickup and it will be removed from the assigned pickup list and added back to the pending pickup list
--- mark an assigned pickup as completed
